This application installs several programs necessary for light sensor set-up and data collection such as TinyOS and sMAP. It also walks the user through the installation of Smart Lighting light sensors and a BaseStation. The application then creates a local sqlite3 database for storing light sensor data. 

1. GeneralDB.py: run the command
    python GeneralDB.py db_info.txt
   to create a local database configured with the information found in db_info.txt

   **WARNING**
   GeneralDB.py is incomplete.

2. make_database.sh: shell script which runs the command 
    python GeneralDB.py db_info.txt

3. nesc.sh: shell script which installs nesc (necessary for TinyOS)

4. pre-install.sh: shell script which must be run before the user starts the installation application. Installs necessary python modules and updates autoconf.

5. smap_install.sh: shell script which installs sMAP software.

6. tinyos_install.sh: shell script which installs TinyOS software and configures TinyOS directories for Smart Lighting sensors.

7. install.py: the Tkinter python installation application.

8. motelist.sh: copies the info from the sensor currently plugged into the computer to moteInfo.txt

9. sample_db_info.txt: sample of the txt file generated by the installation program ('db_info.txt' -- untracked on git); intended to be fed into GeneralDB.py so that the database can be customized.

10. writeUUIDS.sh: obtains UUIDs of each sensor from sMAP and writes them to 'db_info.txt' (untracked on git)

    **WARNING**
    writeUUIDS.sh is incomplete (we have not been using sMAP to collect sensor data).

Other files (*.nc, App, and PythonFiles) are supplementary files needed to program the sensors.
